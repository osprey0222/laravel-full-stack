                        <p>Tamworth Volleyball Club was founded in 1982 and has always prided itself on being a friendly, inclusive community volleyball club.</p>
                        <p>We have always been a competitive club, having won mens and ladies honours in the West Midlands, Leicester and Birmingham and District competitions. In 2015/16, the club made its debut in the National Volleyball League (NVL), with our ladies entering Division 3. Two seasons later, our men followed suit, securing promotion into Division 2 at the first time of asking. As well as competing at the highest possible level, the club is equally passionate about developing juniors and beginners. We want to make sure we offer something to everyone from the recreational player through to the most experienced competitive player.</p>
                        <p>The past two seasons have been incredibly successful, resulting in a haul of nine local league trophies and an NVL promotion. Last season, this saw our ladies win their first ever local league and cup double. Our men won the local league for the second consecutive year while our second team claimed the mens second division trophy as well. Looking to continue this success into the 2019/20 season, we are running six teams; Tamworth Spartans in Women's NVL Division 3 Central; Tamworth Spartans in Men's NVL Division 2 North; both Tamworth Spartans 1 and Tamworth Spartans 2 in West Midlands Mens Division 1; Tamworth Spartans Ladies in West Midlands Division 1; and Tamworth Spartans Ladies 2 in West Midlands Division 2. We also have a thriving junior section, where players train weekly as well as participating in local junior competitions.</p>
                        <p>Several years ago, ahead of the 2012/13 season, the club was rebranded as Tamworth Spartans V.C. Part of the thinking behind this change was to give our club a more modern look and feel. Equally though, it was about creating a brand which reflects sporting excellence. Find out more about out previous successes on our roll of honour, honours board and hall of fame pages. And if you want to know who our committee is, you'll find everyone you need to know here.
                            <p>If you know your history, youll know that the Spartans were fearsome warriors who rarely tasted defeat and whose pursuit of physical excellence was legendary. If you can establish that sort of mentality and ethos within a club, then who would bet against you being successful in anything you turn your hand to?! This is Tamworth!!</p>
